# git-repositories
Project to analyze other git repositories

This project was developed by a team of myself and 3 other students for our final class project.

What it does: 

Upon start-up, you are presented with an empty home page. From there you can view other repositories that are saved in the database.
In order to analyze your own database, you must first register an account. The system asks for an email but does not currently check it,
so you can just enter whatever you like currently. The account name can be any collection of letters, numbers or symbols.
The password is the same way, and is hashed before it is stored into the database.

Once logged in, a new Tab will have become accessible named 'Form'. From that tab you can select which repository you wish to analyze
and what type of data you want to parse for. After enterting in all requested information, a graph will appear based on your selections.

Future plans included refined ability to parse repositories, a cleaner U.I. and more, however it is no longer under my jurisdiction as it
is an intended project for future students and I have already graduated.
